If you downloaded the binary distribution: 

The command to run an example (taken from the OAEI 2010 benchmark) is

java -Xmx2000m -jar knofuss-standalone.jar -c example/example-config-restaurant.rdf




If you checked out the source code from SVN:

The source code can be built using the Apache ant build file:

ant dist

Then, if the task is completed successfully, the command to run the same example is

java -Xmx2000m -jar dist/knofuss-standalone.jar -c example/example-config-restaurant.rdf
