#summary KnoFuss description.

= Introduction =

KnoFuss is a system for semantic data fusion. It takes as input two semantic datasets represented in RDF and resolves the data linking problem:

  * Different datasets often contain information about the same entities but refer to them using different URIs. Such individuals have to be identified and either merged (by replacing URIs) or linked (e.g., using owl:sameAs relations). This problem is similar to the record linkage task studied in the database community.
